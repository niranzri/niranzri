### Hi, I'm Noelia! 👋

My name is Noelia, and I'm a junior software developer. 
I'm a Barcelonian currently based in 🇳🇱. I also spent 3 wonderful years in the city of a thousand trades 🇬🇧. 

## About Me

During my Physics degree I discovered my passion for coding, but i wasn't until after a few years in academic Philosophy that I realised how much I missed STEM. 
My highly analytical and creative profile aligns perfectly with a career in tech. In particular, a career in full-stack: I appreciate well-structured and aesthetically pleasing apps, making me a true all-rounder!

Since 2019 Ive completed numerous courses with *Code First: Girls*, a UK-based social enterprise that provides free coding courses to women and non-binary people. Most recently, I graduated from *Ironhack*'s remote web development bootcamp. My current focus is on continuing to grow my skills through personal projects in the following stack: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, **React**, **NodeJS**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Python**.

In my free time, I'm an avid boulderer and climber 🧗🏻‍♀️. I also enjoy singing, reading, and going to all sorts of cultural and artsy activities 🎨.

Here you can explore some of the personal projects I've recently completed:
