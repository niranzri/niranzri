# Hi, I'm Noelia! 👋

My name is Noelia, and I'm a junior software engineer. 

I'm a Barcelonian based in the 🇳🇱. I also spent 3 wonderful years in the city of a thousand trades 🇬🇧. 

## About Me

During my Physics degree I discovered my passion for coding, but it wasn't until after a few years in academic Philosophy that I realised how much I missed STEM. 
That's why I re-trained in software development. 

Since 2019 Ive completed numerous courses with *Code First: Girls*, a UK-based social enterprise that provides free coding courses to women and non-binary people, and in February 2024 I graduated from *Ironhack*'s remote web development bootcamp. 
I currently work as junior software enginner at *We Are Percent*. 

In my free time, I'm an avid boulderer and climber 🧗🏻‍♀️. I also enjoy singing, reading, and doing all sorts of cultural and artsy activities 🎨.

Here you can explore some of my past projects:
